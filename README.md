Hangman AI
==========

Built JavaScript Hangman game that runs results in Chrome Inspecter (or equivalent in other browsers). The game is built to run for a user play or the computer to play. Currently set to have the computer play and run multiple games while graphing the success rate. There is a text list of words that are used to randomly pull a word for the game and then the corpus is used and shortened with the initial size of the word and then based on the results of each guess. Basically the corpus is cut down in size based on the information gathered from guesses.

I built this with my mentor Yoh and we did it to have fun as well as to help me understand prototypal inheritance as well as apply machine learning techniques and a little data viz.
